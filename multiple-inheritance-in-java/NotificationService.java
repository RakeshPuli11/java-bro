// this classs is sed to implement the implementation of the interfaces just like multiple inheritance

// In Spring Boot, the approach i've described aligns with the principles
//  of dependency injection and inversion of control (IoC) that Spring is built upon.

// When you define a service class in Spring, such as NotificationService, and it implements one or
//  more interfaces, Spring can manage and inject instances of that service into other components, like 
//  Main class. The Main class doesn't need to know the implementation details of NotificationService
//   â€“ it only needs to know about the contract specified by the interfaces.
